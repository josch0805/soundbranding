    "lyrics": "In the shadows where the city breathes,\nA lonely heart finds its release.\nNeon lights, they flicker bright,\nBut in the dark, I see your light.\n\nRefrain:\nOh, you're a spark in the urban night,\nA beacon calling through the noise and fight.\nWith every step, you pull me near,\nIn the chaos, you're the only sound I hear.\n\nThe world is fast, it's cold, it's vast,\nBut with you here, I know I'll last.\nThrough the noise, we'll find our place,\nIn this endless, restless city space.\n\nRefrain:\nOh, you're a spark in the urban night,\nA beacon calling through the noise and fight.\nWith every step, you pull me near,\nIn the chaos, you're the only sound I hear.\n\nLet's lose ourselves in the moment's hue,\nLet the city's pulse become our truth.\nFor in the crowd, I've found a friend,\nTogether we'll rise above the end.\n\nRefrain:\nOh, you're a spark in the urban night,\nA beacon calling through the noise and fight.\nWith every step, you pull me near,\nIn the chaos, you're the only sound I hear.",
